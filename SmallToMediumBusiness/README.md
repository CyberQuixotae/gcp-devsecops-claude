## üí∞ Cost Considerations for SMBs

### Included (Standard Pricing)
- Cloud KMS: ~$1/month per key
- Secret Manager: ~$0.06 per secret per month
- Cloud Logging: First 50GB/month free
- Cloud Monitoring: Free tier available
- Binary Authorization: No additional cost

### Optional (Premium Features)
- **Security Command Center Premium**: $1,000+/month (disabled by default)
- **Flow Logs**: Can be expensive for high-traffic networks (disabled by default)
- **Extended Log Retention**: Additional storage costs

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **GCP Organization** - Required for Security Command Center
2. **Billing Account** - With appropriate permissions
3. **Terraform** - Version 1.0 or higher
4. **gcloud CLI** - For authentication
5. **GPG** - For Binary Authorization (if enabled)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gcp-security-terraform
```

### 2. Authenticate with GCP

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### 3. Configure Variables

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
```

### 4. Generate GPG Key (for Binary Authorization)

```bash
# Generate GPG key pair
gpg --full-generate-key
# Export public key
gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID > attestor-public-key.pgp
```

### 5. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### terraform.tfvars Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `project_id` | GCP Project ID | Yes | - |
| `organization_id` | GCP Organization ID | Yes | - |
| `billing_account` | Billing Account ID | Yes | - |
| `company_name` | Company name for resources | Yes | - |
| `region` | Primary GCP region | No | us-central1 |
| `zone` | Primary GCP zone | No | us-central1-a |
| `admin_users` | List of admin users | No | [] |
| `enable_security_center` | Enable Security Command Center | No | false |
| `enable_binary_auth` | Enable Binary Authorization | No | true |
| `enable_monitoring` | Enable monitoring alerts | No | true |
| `enable_logging` | Enable security logging | No | true |
| `log_retention_days` | Log retention period | No | 30 |
| `enable_flow_logs` | Enable VPC flow logs | No | false |
| `security_email` | Email for security alerts | Yes | - |

### Cost Optimization Settings

For budget-conscious SMBs, consider these settings:

```yaml
# Disable expensive features
enable_security_center = false
enable_flow_logs = false

# Reduce log retention
log_retention_days = 30

# Use smaller VM types
vm_machine_type = "e2-micro"
```

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Verify Security Settings

```bash
# Check IAM policies
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Verify KMS keys
gcloud kms keys list --location=us-central1 --keyring=YOUR_COMPANY-security-keyring

# Check firewall rules
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
```

### 2. Configure Monitoring

1. Go to Cloud Monitoring console
2. Verify notification channels are configured
3. Test alert policies
4. Set up additional custom metrics if needed

### 3. Set Up Binary Authorization (if enabled)

```bash
# Create attestation
gcloud container binauthz attestations sign-and-create \
    --attestor=YOUR_COMPANY-security-attestor \
    --signature-file=signature.sig \
    --public-key-id=security-attestor-key \
    --validate
```

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Default Alert Policies

1. **IAM Policy Changes** - Triggers on any IAM policy modifications
2. **Failed Login Attempts** - Alerts on suspicious login patterns
3. **Unusual Network Activity** - Monitors for anomalous traffic
4. **Resource Creation** - Tracks new resource deployments

### Log Analysis

Security logs are stored in Cloud Storage with the following structure:
- **Location**: `gs://YOUR_PROJECT_ID-security-logs/`
- **Retention**: Configurable (default 30 days)
- **Format**: JSON with structured fields

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Access Control
- Use IAM conditions for fine-grained access
- Implement just-in-time access where possible
- Regular access reviews and cleanup
- Enable MFA for all admin accounts

### Network Security
- Use Private Google Access for internal resources
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular firewall rule audits
- Monitor network traffic patterns

### Data Protection
- Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
- Use Secret Manager for sensitive data
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Regular security assessments

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- Review security alerts and logs
- Update Terraform configurations
- Rotate service account keys
- Review and update firewall rules

### Quarterly Tasks
- Security assessment and penetration testing
- Review and update IAM policies
- Cost optimization review
- Disaster recovery testing

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Not Enabled Error**
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable SERVICE_NAME
   ```

2. **Insufficient Permissions**
   - Verify billing account permissions
   - Check organization-level IAM roles
   - Ensure service account has required roles

3. **KMS Key Access Issues**
   - Verify service account has `cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role
   - Check key ring location matches resource location

4. **Binary Authorization Failures**
   - Verify GPG key is correctly formatted
   - Check attestor configuration
   - Ensure container images are properly signed

### Getting Help

- Check Terraform logs: `terraform apply -debug`
- Review GCP audit logs in Cloud Logging
- Consult GCP documentation: https://cloud.google.com/docs
- File issues in the repository
