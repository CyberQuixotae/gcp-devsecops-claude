GCP Security Engineering with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configurations for implementing comprehensive security controls on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The configuration follows security best practices and implements defense-in-depth strategies.
üîê Security Features Implemented

    Identity & Access Management (IAM): Custom roles, service accounts, conditional access
    Organization Policies: Security constraints and compliance controls
    Key Management: Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with rotation
    Network Security: Private VPCs, Cloud NAT, restrictive firewall rules
    Compute Security: Shielded VMs, Confidential Computing, OS Login
    Monitoring & Alerting: Security event logging, Cloud Monitoring alerts
    Application Security: Cloud Armor WAF, Binary Authorization
    Compliance: Audit logging, policy enforcement

üìã Prerequisites
Required Tools

    Terraform >= 1.0
    Google Cloud SDK >= 400.0.0
    Git

Required Permissions

You need the following IAM roles to deploy this configuration:

bash

# Organization-level roles (if using org policies)
roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin

# Project-level roles
roles/owner
# OR the following specific roles:
roles/compute.admin
roles/iam.admin
roles/cloudkms.admin
roles/securitycenter.admin
roles/binaryauthorization.admin
roles/logging.admin
roles/monitoring.admin
roles/pubsub.admin

GCP Project Setup

    Create a new GCP project or use an existing one
    Enable billing on the project
    Note your Organization ID (if using organization policies)

üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone and Setup

# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gcp-security-terraform
```
# Copy the example tfvars file
```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

2. Configure Variables

# Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values:
# Required variables
```bash
project_id = "your-project-id"
organization_id = "your-org-id"
organization_domain = "yourcompany.com"
security_team_email = "security@yourcompany.com"
```

# Optional customizations
region = "us-central1"
environment = "prod"

3. Authentication

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```
# Set your project
```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```
4. Deploy Infrastructure

# Initialize Terraform
`terraform init`

# Review the plan
`terraform plan`

# Apply the configuration
`terraform apply`

üìÅ File Structure

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf                    # Main Terraform configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars          # Your environment variables (DO NOT COMMIT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars.example  # Template for variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                # Git ignore file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attestor.pub              # Binary Authorization public key (create this)
```

üîë Binary Authorization Setup

Before deploying, you need to create a PGP key pair for Binary Authorization:

bash

# Generate PGP key pair
gpg --quick-generate-key "Security Team <security@yourcompany.com>" rsa4096
gpg --list-keys

# Export public key
gpg --armor --export security@yourcompany.com > attestor.pub

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
Network Architecture

    Private VPC: No auto-subnets, regional routing
    Private Subnet: Internal IPs only with Private Google Access
    Cloud NAT: Outbound internet access for private instances
    Firewall Rules: Restrictive rules with IAP integration

Security Architecture

    IAM: Least privilege with custom roles and conditional access
    Encryption: CMEK encryption for all data at rest
    Monitoring: Comprehensive logging and alerting
    Compliance: Organization policies and audit trails

Compute Architecture

    Shielded VMs: Secure boot, vTPM, integrity monitoring
    Confidential Computing: Encrypted memory processing
    OS Login: Centralized SSH key management
    No External IPs: All instances are private

üîç Monitoring and Alerting

The configuration creates several monitoring components:
Alert Policies

    High severity security findings
    Suspicious authentication activity
    Resource creation anomalies
    Policy violations

Log Sinks

    Security audit logs to Pub/Sub
    Failed authentication attempts
    Administrative actions
    Resource modifications

Notification Channels

    Email notifications to security team
    Pub/Sub topics for integration
    Cloud Monitoring dashboards

üõ°Ô∏è Security Hardening
Organization Policies Applied

    Restrict VM external IP addresses
    Require OS Login on all instances
    Block service account key creation
    Domain-restricted sharing

Compute Hardening

    Confidential Computing enabled
    Shielded VM features enabled
    Custom boot scripts for OS hardening
    Automatic security updates

Network Hardening

    VPC Flow Logs enabled
    Private Google Access only
    Restrictive firewall rules
    Cloud NAT for outbound only

üìä Cost Considerations
High-Cost Resources

    Cloud KMS: Key operations and storage
    VPC Flow Logs: Storage and processing
    Confidential Computing: Premium pricing
    Cloud Armor: Request processing fees

Cost Optimization Tips

    Adjust VPC Flow Logs sampling rate
    Use sustained use discounts
    Right-size compute instances
    Monitor KMS key usage

üîß Customization
Adding New Regions

To deploy in multiple regions:

hcl

# Add to terraform.tfvars
secondary_region = "us-east1"
secondary_zone = "us-east1-a"

Custom Firewall Rules

```yaml
# Add custom rules to the firewall section
resource "google_compute_firewall" "custom_rule" {
  name    = "allow-custom-app"
  network = google_compute_network.secure_vpc.name
  
  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["8080"]
  }
  
  source_tags = ["web-servers"]
  target_tags = ["app-servers"]
}
```
Additional Monitoring

Extend monitoring with custom metrics:

hcl

resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "custom_alert" {
  display_name = "Custom Security Alert"
  # ... configuration
}

üö® Troubleshooting

    API Not Enabled Error

    bash

    # Enable required APIs manually
    gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com

    Insufficient Permissions

    bash

    # Check current permissions
    gcloud auth list
    gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID

    Organization Policy Conflicts

    bash

    # Check existing policies
    gcloud resource-manager org-policies list --organization=ORG_ID

    Resource Quotas

    bash

    # Check quotas
    gcloud compute project-info describe --project=PROJECT_ID

Terraform State Issues

# Import existing resources
terraform import google_project.project PROJECT_ID

# Refresh state
terraform refresh

# Force unlock (if needed)
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

    Never commit terraform.tfvars - contains sensitive information
    Use separate environments - dev/staging/prod isolation
    Regular security reviews - audit access and permissions
    Monitor all changes - track infrastructure modifications
    Test disaster recovery - verify backup and restore procedures
